- Open `thesis.tex` with a LaTeX editor (e.g., `Kyle` or `TeXMaker`)
- Compile `thesis.tex` with `bibtex` and `pdflatex` to produce the PDF of your thesis
- Start writing your thesis, and commit/push often

### General information

- When to start writing?
    - As soon as you have stable results to report. 
    - You may start early writing the background.
    - Wait for results to be stable to write the bulk of your thesis (as the actual implementation is usually the most costly and time-consuming part of the job).
    - Write introduction/abstract/conclusion at last.
- Your thesis is *yours*.
    - Your supervisor can help you with that, but he/she is not a proofreader. So, your thesis is not something that "has to be checked/corrected" by someone.
    - However, ask for advice, especially for the most important issues (e.g., structure), early.
- Consider using tools like [LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool) for spell and grammar checking
