# Latex Template for Theses

## How to use this template

- Clone or (better) fork this repository
- Open `thesis.tex` with a LaTeX editor (e.g., `Kyle` or `TeXMaker`)
- Compile `thesis.tex` with `bibtex` and `pdflatex` to produce the PDF of your thesis
- Start writing your thesis, and commit/push often

## Working with LaTeX

## General information about Theses

#### What is a thesis and what to expect about it (see also [this](https://shorelight.com/student-stories/what-is-a-thesis/)]

- IN GENERAL: "A thesis identifies a question on a topic that relates to your degree program, which you then have to answer with a sensible argument, using credible research and findings."
- Kinds of thesis in Engineering Degrees
    - **Project thesis**: the thesis documents an engineering project
    - **Research thesis**: a coherent and cohesive narrative describing a body of scholarly activity that adds to knowledge
- WHAT IS A THESIS FOR YOU: A thesis is a good chance to exhibit your technical skills (competence in the matter of study) and soft skills (e.g., autonomy, proactiveness, creativity) on a problem that you like and want to address in a field/area you want to explore

#### Student responsibility vs. (co-)supervisor responsibilities

- The student is responsible for
    - the content of the thesis and its final quality
- The (co-)supervisor is responsible for
    - providing *guidance* and *support*
- Note: your thesis is **yours**.
    - Your supervisor can help you with that, but he/she is not a proofreader. So, your thesis is not something that "has to be checked/corrected" by someone.
    - However, ask for advice, especially for the most important issues (e.g., goals, dissertation structure), early.

#### Relationship with (co-)supervisor

- How often should I contact my thesis (co-)supervisor, for what, and how?
    - As often as agreed with the (co-)supervisor.
        - A typical frequency is once every two weeks, or as often as there are significant increments.
    - You should contact your (co-)supervisor for "important" stuff and "strategic" decisions, rather than implementation details.
    - If you have minor questions and doubts, wait enough time to have a batch of these, and pose all the questions, numbered, in a single e-mail.
- What if I have a blocking situation that prevents progress?
    - If it is a technical issue, spend some time exploring for solutions. If you can't find a solution, contact your (co-)supervisor, with a detailed mail explaining the problem, your tentative solutions, etc.
    
### On writing a thesis

- Use **LaTeX**
- Typical steps
    1. Define the high-level structure (i.e., the Sections) of the thesis
    2. You may optionally start writing the background content, as it may serve to make it explicit and fully understand it in order to develop the contribution
    3. Complete the main content (contribution, experiments)
        * If technical developments and experiments are needed, wait to have them done: this part of the thesis is a documentation of what you have achieved (i.e., the final system, the experimental results etc.).
    4. Write Title, Introduction, Conclusion, and Abstract
- *Q: When to start writing?*
    - As soon as you have stable results to report. 
    - You may start early writing the background.
    - Wait for results to be stable to write the bulk of your thesis (as the actual implementation is usually the most costly and time-consuming part of the job).
    - Write introduction/abstract/conclusion at last.
- How to check for typos and grammatical issues?
    - NOTE: it is not a responsibility of the (co-)supervisor to find or fix these
    - Consider using tools like [LanguageTool](https://github.com/languagetool-org/languagetool) for spell and grammar checking
